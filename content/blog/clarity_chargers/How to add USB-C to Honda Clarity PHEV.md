# How to add USB-C to Honda Clarity PHEV

This guide will walk you through the process of adding modern USB-C charging
ports to your Honda Clarity PHEV, both in the front niche and the rear console.
This is a relatively simple modification that can be done with basic tools and
some patience.

## Tools and spares needed

- Pry tool
- Screwdriver or power drill
- Step drill
- Wire strippers
- Soldering iron, solder, flux
- Spare wiring
- Multimeter
- USB-C charging sockets (bought mine from AliExpress)
- TESA Automotive fabric tape
- Heat-shrinkable tubing (and heat gun) or insulation tape

## Part 1: Front niche Installation

This section covers the installation in the front panel that houses the 12V
power outlet.

### 1. Disassembly

First, you need to remove the panel.

There is keyless access antenna behind that panel. You should unscrew it.

break them how I almost do.](/blog/clarity_chargers/resources/IMG_3305.jpeg)

### 2. Drilling and Chargers Installation

Now it's time to make space for the new USB-C sockets and connect them.

![Use a step drill to create the holes for the new sockets. Measure the diameter
of your USB-C chargers to ensure a snug fit.](/blog/clarity_chargers/resources/IMG_3308.jpeg)

But we cannot install the panel now because there is a keyless access antenna
bracket behind the panel. It needs to be removed, and a space cut out for the
chargers.

### 3. Wiring Preparation

Next, prepare the wiring to power the new sockets.
We will take power from stock cigarette lighting socket.
Lets use our spare wiring to create Y-connector that powers additional chargers.

![Prepare your spare wiring and soldering tools.](/blog/clarity_chargers/resources/IMG_3316.jpeg)
*Prepare your spare wiring and soldering tools.*

Measure and strip two pieces of spare wire, 15-20 cm long.

![Solder the wires to create a Y-splitter. This will allow you to power both the
original 12V socket and the new USB-C sockets.](/blog/clarity_chargers/resources/IMG_3317.jpeg)

Now time to connect our new harness to wires of the cigarette lighter power
connector.

## Part 2: Rear Console Installation

### 1. Disassembly rear console

For the rear console, the process is similar and involves accessing the power
source from the rear 12V outlet.

The rear panel is very easy to remove—just pull it toward you firmly.

### 2. Drilling and Rear chargers Installation

![The chargers I prepared for installation didn't quite fit, or rather, the nuts
that secure them didn't fit, so I had to remove some plastic from the inside
around the intended installation site—on either side of the standard cigarette
lighter socket.](/blog/clarity_chargers/resources/IMG_3328.jpeg)

### 3. Wiring and assembling

We do the rear wiring (Y-connector) in the same way as the front wiring.

![Then connect it to original socket's connector wires.](/blog/clarity_chargers/resources/IMG_3331.jpeg)

![And wrap all additional harness in fabric tape](/blog/clarity_chargers/resources/IMG_3332.jpeg)

Now, simply reverse the disassembly process.
Just carefully snap the console panel back into place.

Enjoy your new, modern charging setup!
